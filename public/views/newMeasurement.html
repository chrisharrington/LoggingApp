If what you want to log with this measurement isn't quantifiable, you want to <a href='#/new-log/tag'>add a tag</a> instead.<br /><br />In our running metaphor, the quantity would be '5' if you just ran a 5K, and duration would be '10' if you finished the race in 10 seconds and you're the Flash."></info-input>

For example, if you're tracking what you ate today and for some reason you had eight apples for lunch, adding a measurement with name 'apples' and quantity of '8' doesn't need any units. If you're logging that run, though, you should specify whether or not the quantity of '5' is in miles, kilometres or leagues."></info-input>
